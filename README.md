# Title

Cyclone NFT MarketPlace

# Description

Cyclone NFT MarketPlace is a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace where users can buy, sell, or create NFTs. It is a noncustodial platform, allowing users full control and access to their cryptocurrency wallets. Users interact directly with other users to buy or sell an NFT or a bundle of NFTs.

The problem that Cyclone NFT marketplace solve is the lack of a standardized way to monetize and authenticate digital assets. Before NFTs, digital assets such as art, music, and collectibles could be easily duplicated or copied, making it difficult for creators to prove ownership and monetize their work. With NFTs, creators can assign a unique token to their digital asset, making it one-of-a-kind and easily verifiable as authentic. This allows creators to sell their work as collectibles or unique items, and buyers to own and trade those items as they would physical assets.

## Credits

The Cyclone NFT Marketplace of this app was inspired by daulathussain
(https://github.com/daulathussain/nftMarketplace-Subscription) some of it's Components and styling were used. Also, the contract from this article (https://betterprogramming.pub/creating-an-nft-marketplace-solidity-2323abca6346) was also used. The contract has been optimized to reduce gas fee, unneccessary function has been removed and the component has been modified to work according to my needs.

## !IMPORTANT

My Infura keys has been made available for a while to aid interaction with function.
It Would be made Unavailable on a later date. It has also been restricted to limit the amount of data that can be uploaded to ipfs to prevent billing.
